* New in 1.1 (not yet released):

** (weinholt bytevectors): Added bytevector=?/constant-time

The procedure bytevector=?/constant-time compares two bytevectors by
summing up their differences.

** (weinholt crypto blowfish): New procedures for CBC mode

The procedures blowfish-cbc-encrypt! and blowfish-cbc-decrypt! were
added.

** (weinholt crypto dh): New library for Diffie-Hellman key exchange

This code was previously spread out in different libraries. The
library exports make-dh-secret, expt-mod and a few MODP groups.

** (weinholt crypto dsa): Better secret numbers for signatures

The per-message secret number used by dsa-create-signature is now
generated more in accordance with FIPS 186-3 Appendix B.2.1.

** (weinholt crypto md5): Added md5-96 and equality predicates

Added md5-length, md5-96-copy-hash!, md5-hash=? and md5-96-hash=?. The
-96 procedures work with the leftmost 96 bits of a hash. The equality
predicate compares an md5 state with a bytevector in a manner intended
to not leak timing information about the comparison.

** (weinholt crypto openpgp): New exports

Added port-ascii-armormed? which checks if the data on a binary input
port looks like a binary OpenPGP packet or not. The procedure
get-openpgp-packet was added to the exports.

** (weinholt crypto sha-1): Added sha-1-96 and equality predicates

Same changes as the md5 library.

** (weinholt crypto sha-2): Equality predicates and HMAC bug fix

Same changes as the md5 library except that the -96 procedures are
-128 here. There are also bug fixes: the procedures hmac-sha-384 and
hmac-sha-512 were previously defined using an incorrect block size.
This change makes the output incompatible with previous versions, so
the major version was incremented to 1. Another bug fixed was that the
hmac procedures couldn't handle key lengths larger than the block
size.
