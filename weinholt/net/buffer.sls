;; Input buffering suitable for some binary network protocols.

;; This is not a port abstraction. If you e.g. want to implement a
;; protocol that uses both UDP and TCP, and you can normally make do
;; with a binary input port, then use open-bytevector-input-port when
;; using UDP.

;; This library is useful for when you have a protocol that uses
;; framing, but perhaps in an inconsistent way, and you need random
;; access inside whole frames. With this library you would not need to
;; append bytevectors and there might be less consing.

;; This library only does big-endian, since that is the normal network
;; byte order.

;; TODO: proper conditions
